# maven-inventorymanagement
The Inventory Management app is a desktop app that uses layered-architecture, the Swing library for GUI development, Maven for dependency management, and MySQL-Server for data storage.

*The primary purpose of the app is the demonstration of layer-based code organization and automated dependency management through Maven. Thus, only a small part of the front-end functionality has been developed.
